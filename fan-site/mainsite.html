    <h1>My Collection of Weird Images</h1>

    <h2>What defines a weird image?</h2>
    <p>A weird image is not simply a weird image. If it has context, then it's not weird. If it's justifiable and explainable, than it's simply odd. But a weird image is absurd without explanation. If you can't describe what it means, it's truly strange.</p>

    <h3>Cube Jerry</h3>
    <img src="cube jerry.jpg" alt="Cube Jerry">
    <p>This is a good example of a weird image. You may recognise this character. But it's highly unlikely you have ever seen something like this before. Confuesd? That's why this image is a perfect example.</p>

    <img src="chicken man.png" alt="A man wearing a chicken as a facemask">
    <p>Another example. This one is good because you don't know who this guy is. Where is he? Is he in a bathroom? Why's he wearing a chicken on his face? These things can't be explained, and that's why this image is almost therapy.</p>

    <img src="rattle me bones.jpg" alt="A man being chased by a skeleton">
    <p>This one incites horror. It strikes fear into the bravest of individuals. Where is this guy? Is his gun going to work against the strength of these calcium-fuelled skeleton warrior? What is this man going to do? Why is he there? Will he survive? No answers.</p>

    <h2>Good attributes of a strange image</h2>
    <p>Here are some essential attributes a strange image should possess.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Unexplainable</li>
      <li>Slightly terrifying</li>
      <li>Somewhere unknown</li>
      <li>No context</li>
      <li>Some basic humour</li>
    </ul>
